# Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated a wide array of accessibility improvements that can
be introduced to line charts, making them usable for a broader spectrum of
users. The considerations and methods presented illustrate the importance of
creating inclusive web applications.

Among the discussed topics were:

1. **Keyboard Navigation:** The implementation of
keyboard-only navigation on our chart, allowing for interaction exclusively
through keystrokes.
2. **ARIA roles and Descriptive Content:** The additions of ARIA
labels, live regions, and the hiding of non-consequential elements to enhance
the usefulness of assistive technologies and to communicate context better to
all users.
3. **High Contrast and Scalable Font Size:** The detection of the user's
preference for higher contrast and the inclusion of customizable text sizes for
better readability.

The tutorial covers these significant points, yet the example provided enriches
the line chart with more improvements. One such enhancement is an informative
tooltip that lists available commands, adding another helpful layer of user
instruction.

Creating accessible web designs results in versatile applications, amenable to a
diverse array of users with varying abilities and preferences. The methodology
underpinning this tutorial can find application in many other web development
contexts, illustrating the universal applicability of good accessibility
practices.

This tutorial aimed to foster a better understanding of these practices,
promoting an inclusive web where applications are made with everyone in mind.
